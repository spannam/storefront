<strong>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS</strong><br>
Setting your font in the body (CSS) would have saved you from having to place it in all of
the divs, and it looks like you missed one in your "coded by" content. Watch in your
HTML so you don't have leftover code (you have a <seection> in there, because its
misspelled the browser ignores it. Solid styling and color choices, this is a nice looking
page. The maincontent type size is a bit small. Good work, overall.
